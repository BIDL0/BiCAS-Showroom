# Bidlo's Cellular Automata Simulator
Bidlo's Cellular Automata Simulator (BiCAS.py) is a simple Python-based 2D
cellular automata simulator intended mainly for educational and research
purposes. It is needed to have Pygame (https://www.pygame.org) and NumPy
(http://www.numpy.org/) libraries installed to run BiCAS. The simulator uses Python 3. This project provides
some examples of non-trivial multi-state uniform cellular automata demonstrating
selected case studies of pattern development problem -- something that is easy
to visualise and at least a bit interesting to observe (i.e. the cellular
automata development). In order to run an example, execute a *.run file and
follow the on-screen instructions.

The results included in this project have been obtained using the concept
of Conditionally Matching Rules (CMRs) as described in the following paper:

Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, vol. 20, no. 5, 2016, pp. 742-754.

```

**PLEASE CITE THIS PAPER IN CASE OF ANY FURTHER PUBLICATION INSPIRED BY THIS IDEA.**

If you manage to discover other nicely behaving cellular automata (by any means
using BiCAS) or just find this interesting, please let me know. You can find my

Enjoy!
